"""

    Consolidated Module that take in series of search keys and crawl the results of each website.



    Learning:
        joining two lists
        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15703590/combining-two-lists-to-string

    Updates:
        Jul 30 2015: Updates on more options , date enabling, sentence control
        Jun 09 2015: Add in get_searchlist_fr_file function

    To do:
        enable differrn kind of search.
        use the differnt symbol to separate the search-->use ability from the multiple sbr soring.
        Make sure there is no overlapping of search --> there is (Bug) how to split the search to make sure no overlaop
        Enable date search as well.
        Also the the data seems fragmented --> need to settle on the \n portion.
        Secondary search reinforce on the correct search
        Add in date filter

        Need command line args

    Bugs:
        it seems that the website and content may not be accurate.
        may not be able to turn off the consolidated_results
        or something happen during merging..... (to monitor)
